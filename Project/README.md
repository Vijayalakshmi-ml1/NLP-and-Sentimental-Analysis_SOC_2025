# NLP Capstone Project  
## Mapping the Emotional Arc of a Harry Potter Novel 

Welcome to the capstone project of our 10-week NLP learning journey! This repository contains the structure, expectations, and resources for your final project ‚Äî a sentiment analysis of a Harry Potter novel. You‚Äôll apply your NLP skills to extract emotional patterns from narrative text and present compelling visual and analytical insights.

---

## Objective

- Analyze the **emotional progression** of a Harry Potter novel using NLP techniques.
- Explore **character-specific sentiment trajectories** across the story.
- Visualize insights through well-structured plots and explain the findings clearly.

By the end of this project, you'll build a **data-driven emotional storyline** from one of the world‚Äôs most magical series!

---

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Text Preparation & Preprocessing

- Choose **any one** Harry Potter novel in `.txt` format.
  - Note: Due to copyright, you may need to source text responsibly.
- **Segment** the novel into chapters using markers like `"CHAPTER"` or `"Chapter"`.
- Store the text as a list or DataFrame.
- Apply standard preprocessing:
  - Lowercasing
  - Punctuation/special character removal
  - Tokenization (`nltk`, `spaCy`)
  - Stopword removal
  - Stemming or Lemmatization
  - POS Tagging *(optional)*

### Phase 2: Sentiment Analysis

Choose one or more of the following techniques:

| Method                  | Tools/Libraries              | Notes                                                  |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Rule-Based              | `VADER`, `TextBlob`          | Quick, interpretable, great for short text            |
| ML-Based                | `Naive Bayes`, `LogisticRegression` with TF-IDF | Train on datasets like IMDB or Amazon Reviews |
| Pre-trained Transformers| `BERT`, `RoBERTa` via `transformers` | Context-aware sentiment, advanced option           |

#### Deliverables:
- Compute sentiment **per chapter**
- (Optional) Perform sentiment analysis on **character-specific** text snippets

---

### Phase 3: Visualization

Use any of the following tools: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`, `altair`

#### Required Plots:
- **Line Chart** of sentiment across chapters
- **Character Emotional Arcs** (Optional): e.g., ‚ÄúHarry‚Äù, ‚ÄúSnape‚Äù, ‚ÄúHermione‚Äù
- **Word Clouds** (Optional): For happy/sad chapters or specific characters
- **Bar/Heatmaps**: Sentiment distribution (positive/neutral/negative)

---

### Phase 4: Interpretation & Analysis

Answer the following in a markdown cell or report:
- How does emotional tone shift across chapters?
- Are there high/low emotional moments (e.g., deaths, betrayals)?
- Which characters show the most emotionally charged language?
- Does the story follow a traditional narrative arc (rising ‚Üí climax ‚Üí resolution)?
