# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Journey â€” From Basics to Harry Potter Sentiment Analysis 

Welcome to the **NLP Learning and Sentiment Analysis Project**, a hands-on, 8-week guided learning journey into the world of Natural Language Processing. This project is designed to equip you with both theoretical foundations and practical experience â€” culminating in a final assignment where you'll analyze the emotional arc of a **Harry Potter novel**.

## What You'll Learn

Over 8 weeks, youâ€™ll master key NLP concepts:

- Tokenization, Stop Words, Stemming, Lemmatization
- Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging
- Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, and Word Embeddings
- Text Classification using Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression
- Sentiment Analysis using real-world datasets
- Visualizing emotional trajectories in narrative text

---

## Final Project

> **Deconstruct the emotional journey of a Harry Potter novel.**

Youâ€™ll:
- Break the novel into chapters
- Perform sentiment analysis on each section
- Track how the overall mood shifts over time
- Visualize the emotional trajectories of key characters
